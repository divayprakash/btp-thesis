\begin{abstract}
The building management HVAC(heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system for Phase II of IIIT-Delhi campus is designed to take care (and advantage) of diversity of use. Instead of using large AHUs(Air Handling Units), we will have individual units in faculty rooms, labs, and other spaces. This would allow us to condition air of the spaces that are occupied and the system would be able to maintain desired temperature more closely. The disadvantage of this approach is higher capital cost and a larger I/O points for BMS but the running cost will be saved. In this project we are developing a scheduler hosted on a web server to control the AC’s valves connected through Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

\section{BMS for phase I}
\ac{hvac} for the Phase I buildings (Academic, Lecture halls and library building) of IIIT-Delhi campus used large floor mounted \ac{ahu}'s to condition large spaces except lecture halls which were served by \ac{csu}'s (ceiling suspended units). Library building has one \ac{ahu} per floor feeding all the labs and rooms. The academic building has 6 AHUs (three serving A wing and the other three wing B). Hostels have one \ac{fcu} per room. The large AHUs of the academic block control volume of cold air by reducing the fan speed using \ac{vfd} drives. As the area per \ac{ahu} is large and the need very diverse (labs with varying number of occupants and equipment vs faculty rooms), the \ac{hvac} system is not very energy efficient and uniform temperature can't be maintained. The \ac{hvac} system has a very basic centralized control that can set temperature to be achieved in each one of the \ac{ahu}s or \ac{csu}s. It also allows switching on/ off, monitoring parameters etc centrally. Other than \ac{ahu}s/\ac{csu}s it can display status and parameters of chillers, cooling towers and hot water generator.
\par
In \ac{bms}/ \ac{hvac} terminology each point that is controlled or read is an \ac{io} point and an \ac{io} summary is prepared for any BMS installation to estimate the cost. The \ac{io} points are of 4 types - digital input, digital output, analog input and analog output. In phase I, we had chosen to only include \ac{io} that either needed to be controlled or the \ac{io} that were to be sensed and used for controlling to contain cost. The system was provided by Trane.
\par
Later a parallel system for monitoring and data collection was implemented by a research group led by Dr Amarjeet Singh. This group installed wireless temperature sensors (13) and Ethernet based power meters (500) all over the campus to optimize HVAC and energy use based on data collected.

\section{\ac{bms} for phase II}
The \ac{hvac} for Phase II of IIIT-Delhi campus is designed to take care (and advantage) of diversity of use. So instead of large \ac{ahu}s, we will have individual units in faculty rooms, labs, and other spaces. This would allow us to condition air of the spaces that are occupied and the system would be able to maintain desired temperature more closely. The disadvantage of this approach is higher capital cost and a larger \ac{io} points for \ac{bms} but the running cost will be saved.

\newpage
\chapter{Problem Statement}\label{chapter:problemstatement}
\onehalfspacing
Given the large number of units to monitor and control, the cost of \ac{bms} was estimated to be very high. In addition, for phase II, the traditional system would be close-ended and proprietary.
\par
Most of the cost (about 60\%) would have been in the wiring the large number of units to controllers. This cost can be saved if individual \ac{wifi}-based controllers (500-600) were to be deployed. These wireless devices can use the existing institute \ac{lan} infrastructure to further save costs.

\end{figure}
The \ac{bms}/ \ac{hvac} system, is structured in the manner described by figure \ref{fig:arch}. At the lowest level is the AHU (Air Handling Unit), which performs the actual cooling/heating functionality of the system. It is controlled by the microcontroller. The microcontroller monitors various system parameters and accordingly runs the \ac{ahu}. It is in turn controlled by a sub-server unit, which is responsible for logging data and passing control instructions to the microcontroller unit according to policies set by the central server. The highlighted sections in figure \ref{fig:arch} are the modules that were worked upon over the course of this project. In addition, code documentation for the entire stack was also written.

\captionsetup{justification=centering}
\caption{Higher level control modules of the building management system}
\label{fig:des}
\end{figure}
The higher level control of the building management system is carried out by the central server in conjunction with various sub-server units managing their own group of microcontroller devices. The details of the central server and the sub-servers are given in the following sections.
\section{Central server}
The central server of the system is a software implementation only. There are no specific hardware requirements for the same. The server is implemented in such a manner so as to be able to provide interfaces to both the sub-server devices using a \ac{rest} \ac{api} and also to system administrators by way of a \ac{gui}. If required, the central server could be on the cloud. The server can be broken down into two main modules, the frontend and the backend. Both of these modules were built over the course of this project.
\subsection{Design specifications}
\subsubsection{Frontend}
The frontend of the central server consists of a hierarchy of web pages created using \ac{html}/\newline \ac{css}/JavaScript/jQuery and the Bootstrap framework. This provides the \ac{gui} which can be used by system administrators for overall analysis/control of the system.
\subsubsection{Backend}
The backend of the central server consists of a web application created using the Python web framework Django. The system used MySQL as the database management system.
\subsection{Design choices}
There are various design choices that had to be made in order to create a cohesive and well-structured central server for the \ac{bms} project. The central server is implemented as a web application. The choice of a web-application was made keeping in mind the advantages of web applications over traditional desktop applications -
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easier deployment - The application does not need to be individual deployed to any client machine. The client machine only requires a functioning web browser to access the system.
    \item Maintenance - System maintenance is vastly easier as all updates and bug fixes need to be introduced at the server end only. In the same manner, regular updates are also easy.
    \item Platform independent - This was the major reason in favour of using a web application. The server implemented as a web application provides complete functionality to clients running any \ac{os}.
    \item Faster development process - By using a web application, users access the system by way of a web browser. This creates a uniform environment across platforms. While user interaction with the application needs to be thoroughly tested on different web browsers, the application itself needs only be developed for a single operating system. There’s no need to develop and test it on all possible operating system versions and configurations. This makes development and troubleshooting much easier.
    \item Scalability - Being independent of hardware configurations, web applications are easily scalable. It is possible to scale the system with growing \ac{io} points or number of client instances.
\end{itemize}
\section{Sub-server}
\subsection{Design specifications}
The sub-servers are individual Raspberry Pi units running a Linux \ac{os} distribution. These devices are connected to the central server using a wired Ethernet connection and each unit manages up to 20 AVR microcontroller units over a \ac{wifi} interface. The Raspberry Pi devices host a web server which provides various functionalities. Over the course of this project, the web server was ported from a \verb|BaseHTTPServer| to a Django-based server, both coded in Python.
\subsection{Design choices}
The choice of using a Raspberry Pi device for the sub-server was made considering the following points -
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ease of deployment - Due to the small size of the device, it is easy to deploy unobtrusively in extremely small spaces such as wiring closets and channels, where a power supply and Ethernet cables are available.
    \item \ac{soc} - The Raspberry Pi provides us a complete system on chip ie. it integrates all the components of a computer on one single chip. This micro-computer does not require any additional chips for its functionality, with built-in Ethernet and \ac{wifi} interfaces.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Implementation}\label{chapter:Implementation}

\section{Central server}
\subsection{Description}
The central server is a Django web application which uses a MySQL \ac{dbms}. The frontend part of the web application is done using \ac{html}/\ac{css} and bootstrap.
\subsection{Functionality}
The web application takes inputs from the user to set the time and temperature range for each micro-controller for which the \ac{ahu}'s should work and logs the data in the MySQL database on the server according to the microcontroller's \ac{mac} address. Central server communicates to sub-servers using the client-server model.
\section{Sub-server}
\subsection{Description}
The Raspberry Pi units serving as sub-servers run a Django based web application which serves a \ac{rest} \ac{api}. This is utilised by both the microcontrollers and the central server which communicate with the device using \ac{http} messages. In addition, the sub-server device also functions as a client in some cases. This is further explained in the next section.
\subsection{Functionality}
\subsubsection{For microcontroller}
All communication taking place between sub-server devices and the microcontrollers follows the client-server model. However, the server (Rapberry Pi device) cannot initiate a message send to the client (microcontroller) without a prior request from the client. Due to memory and threading constraints at the microcontroller end, interrupts have not been used. Thus all communication is initiated by the client device. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data logging - The sub-server device provides a \ac{rest} \ac{api} method for microcontroller devices to log data. The microcontroller devices makes an \ac{http} POST request to the Raspberry Pi sub-server, which processes the attached data and stores it in the database. This data is stored in a MySQL database using microcontroller \ac{mac} addresses and the \ac{http} message timestamp as keys. Thereafter, the sub-server sends a confirmation message back to the client.
    \item Fetching commands - The microcontroller devices also fetch commands from the sub-server units. For this purpose, the microcontroller makes an \ac{http} GET request to the sub-server. The sub-server extracts the microcontroller's \ac{mac} address from the request and queries its database for any pending commands to be sent to that device. If found, it returns the same in the \ac{http} response to the client, else an empty response is sent.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{For central server}
In case of the communication with the central server, the model followed is again client-server model. However, both the sub-server and central server can initiate message sending.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Receive commands - The sub-server device acts as a client for this method, used by the central server to transmit commands to the sub-server using \ac{http} messages.
    \item Send data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item With prior request - This method is followed if the central server requests data logs from the sub-server using an \ac{http} GET message as-and-when required.
        \item With no prior request - The Raspberry Pi device uses an \ac{sd} card to store data persistently. To ensure longevity of the system, it is essential to keep the number of read/write cycles on the card to a minimum. Thus data logs are stored in primary memory. While this solves the \ac{sd} card issue, it creates another as main system memory is being taken up by static data. To resolve this issue, the Raspberry Pi device dumps the data logs to the central server using \ac{http} POST messages at a fixed time interval. This enables the deletion of the files at sub-server end, freeing up valuable memory resources.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
